# Simulations
MATLAB code for simluating mean-field interaction diffusion models, like in [Garnier Papanicolaou 2013](https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/large-deviations-for-a-mean-field-model-of-systemic-risk). 

This requires [SDETools](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/56406-sdetools) and the [Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) to be installed and added to your MATLAB path.
